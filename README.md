FLORESTA VERMELHA
=================

These are the scripts that have been used in the short movie 
'Floresta Vermelha' (Red Forest) - 2012/2013.

They are all GPL, as one might expect.

For better understanding of the scripts, one should take a look at the
following links:

https://szaszak.wordpress.com/linux/digital_cinema_automation/ (English)
Describes the editing workflow for linux, Cinelerra based, and how the scripts 
can automate some demanding tasks of format conversion and XML updating;

https://szaszak.wordpress.com/linux/elphel-as-a-digital-cinema-camera/ (English)
Describes the use of the Elphel 353 as a Digital Cinema camera and how the 
processes of recording video and audio can be helped by the use of scripts.

http://florestavermelha.org/ (Portuguese) - is the production blog for the film.


The folders are divided in:

1. Editing scripts - used for the whole editing/post-editing workflow
2. Elphel internal scripts - to be used inside the Elphel camera, for recording
3. GStreamer scripts - the watch the stream that comes from the camera and 
eventually record this stream
4. MPlayer scripts - to watch the videos during post-production phase, in which
the DNGs are batch converted to sequences of JPEG files
5. References - useful .txt files that serve as references while shooting
6. Utils - useful scripts that can check for problems and/or add functionalities
to the original workflow (for example, connect with a Blender workflow)
7. X11vnc - a simple script to re-send the stream to a mobile device, in case
one choses to use a smartphone (for example) as monitor.


Have a nice time with them!
